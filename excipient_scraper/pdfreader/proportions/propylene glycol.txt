Propylene glycol has become widely used as a solvent, extractant,
and preservative in a variety of parenteral and nonparenteral
pharmaceutical formulations. It is a better general solvent than
glycerin and dissolves a wide variety of materials, such as
corticosteroids, phenols, sulfa drugs, barbiturates, vitamins (A
and D), most alkaloids, and many local anesthetics.
As an antiseptic it is similar to ethanol, and against molds it is
similar to glycerin and only slightly less effective than ethanol.
Propylene glycol is commonly used as a plasticizer in aqueous
film-coating formulations.
Propylene glycol is also used in cosmetics and in the food
industry as a carrier for emulsifiers and as a vehicle for flavors in
preference to ethanol, since its lack of volatility provides a more
uniform flavor. See Table I.
