Propylparaben is widely used as an antimicrobial preservative in
cosmetics, food products, and pharmaceutical formulations; see
Table I.
It may be used alone, in combination with other paraben esters,
or with other antimicrobial agents. It is one of the most frequently
used preservatives in cosmetics.(1)
The parabens are effective over a wide pH range and have a
broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, although they are most
effective against yeasts and molds; see Section 10.
Owing to the poor solubility of the parabens, the paraben salts,
particularly the sodium salt, are frequently used in formulations.
This may cause the pH of poorly buffered formulations to become
more alkaline.
Propylparaben (0.02% w/v) together with methylparaben
(0.18% w/v) has been used for the preservation of various
parenteral pharmaceutical formulations; see Section 14.
See Methylparaben for further information.
