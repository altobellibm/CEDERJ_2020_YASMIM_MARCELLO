Disodium edetate is used as a chelating agent in a wide range of
pharmaceutical preparations, including mouthwashes, ophthalmic
preparations, and topical preparations,(1–3) typically at concentra-
tions between 0.005 and 0.1% w/v.
Disodium edetate forms stable water-soluble complexes (che-
lates) with alkaline earth and heavy-metal ions. The chelated form
has few of the properties of the free ion, and for this reason
chelating agents are often described as ‘removing’ ions from
solution, a process known as sequestering. The stability of the
metal–edetate complex is dependent on the metal ion involved and
the pH.
Disodium edetate is also used as a water softener as it will chelate
calcium and magnesium ions present in hard water. It is also used
therapeutically as an anticoagulant as it will chelate calcium and
prevent the coagulation of blood in vitro. Concentrations of 0.1%
w/v are used in small volumes for hematological testing and 0.3%
w/v in transfusions.
