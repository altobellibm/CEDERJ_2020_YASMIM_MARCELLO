Methylparaben is widely used as an antimicrobial preservative in
cosmetics, food products, and pharmaceutical formulations; see
Table I. It may be used either alone or in combination with other

parabens or with other antimicrobial agents. In cosmetics,
methylparaben is the most frequently used antimicrobial preserva-
tive.(1)
The parabens are effective over a wide pH range and have a
broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, although they are most
effective against yeasts and molds. Antimicrobial activity increases
as the chain length of the alkyl moiety is increased, but aqueous
solubility decreases; therefore a mixture of parabens is frequently
used to provide effective preservation. Preservative efficacy is also
improved by the addition of propylene glycol (2–5%), or by using
parabens in combination with other antimicrobial agents such as
imidurea; see Section 10.
Owing to the poor solubility of the parabens, paraben salts
(particularly the sodium salt) are more frequently used in
formulations. However, this raises the pH of poorly buffered
formulations.
Methylparaben (0.18%) together with propylparaben (0.02%)
has been used for the preservation of various parenteral pharma-
ceutical formulations; see Section 14.
