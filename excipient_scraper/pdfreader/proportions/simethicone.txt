The main use of simethicone as an excipient is as an antifoaming
agent in pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, for which
1–50 ppm is used.
Therapeutically, simethicone is included in a number of oral
pharmaceutical formulations as an antiflatulent, although its
therapeutic benefit is questionable.(1,2) It is also included in antacid
products such as tablets or capsules.(3–7) In some types of surgical or
gastroscopic procedures where gas is used to inflate the body cavity,
a defoaming preparation containing simethicone may be used in the
area to control foaming of the fluids.
When simethicone is used in aqueous formulations, it should be
emulsified to ensure compatibility with the aqueous system and
components.
In the USA, up to 10 ppm of simethicone may be used in food
products.
