Sodium metabisulfite is used as an antioxidant in oral, parenteral,
and topical pharmaceutical formulations, at concentrations of
0.01â€“1.0% w/v, and at a concentration of approximately 27% w/v
in intramuscular injection preparations. Primarily, sodium metabi-
sulfite is used in acidic preparations; for alkaline preparations,
sodium sulfite is usually preferred; see Section 18. Sodium
metabisulfite also has some antimicrobial activity, which is greatest
at acid pH, and may be used as a preservative in oral preparations
such as syrups.
In the food industry and in wine production, sodium metabi-
sulfite is similarly used as an antioxidant, antimicrobial preserva-
tive, and antibrowning agent. However, at concentrations above
about 550 ppm it imparts a noticeable flavor to preparations.
Sodium metabisulfite usually contains small amounts of sodium
sulfite and sodium sulfate.
