Isopropyl alcohol (propan-2-ol) is used in cosmetics and pharma-
ceutical formulations, primarily as a solvent in topical formula-
tions.(1) It is not recommended for oral use owing to its toxicity; see
Section 14.
Although it is used in lotions, the marked degreasing properties
of isopropyl alcohol may limit its usefulness in preparations used
repeatedly. Isopropyl alcohol is also used as a solvent both for tablet
film-coating and for tablet granulation,(2) where the isopropyl
alcohol is subsequently removed by evaporation. It has also been
shown to significantly increase the skin permeability of nimesulide
from carbomer 934.(3)
Isopropyl alcohol has some antimicrobial activity (see Section
10) and a 70% v/v aqueous solution is used as a topical disinfectant.
Therapeutically, isopropyl alcohol has been investigated for the
treatment of postoperative nausea or vomiting.(4)
